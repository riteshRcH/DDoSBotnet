# DDoSBotnet 2014

Botnet is basically an army of compromised hosts that have software bots running in background. These bots blindly follow the commands given by a central Command and Control (CNC) Server. My project had a CNC FTP and Web based server hosted over DDNS which commanded bots located at remote locations to carry out Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a victim server using different methods such as PingFlood, TCP SYN Flood etc.
